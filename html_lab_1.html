        <p style="color:rgb(116, 11, 4);">So hiii! I'm Sofia and there really is no good way to describe myself. I simply exist within the restraints of my reality. Haha, just kidding, it is not that serious. Anyways, I am a Coptic Orthodox Christian, and I go to St. George and St. Shenouda Church. <br> To characterize myself more, let me tell you about my likes and dislikes. I absolutely love to read and sometimes I try my hand at writing. I love stickers for some strange reason. I love decorating my stuff with stickers, but then I get attached to my stickers, so I don't really use them that much. I guess I just collect them haha. Now onto what I hate. I hate mushrooms with a passion, they taste horrible. I also hate procrasination due to my tendency to do it 24/7. <br> And yeah, let me tell you about my family. I have two parental units that I love, and two younger siblings that I try to love. Haha, just kidding, I love them (I think). But yeah, that's all I've got to say about myself. Oh wait!
            I would love to one day have a pet turtle like the image below. </p>
